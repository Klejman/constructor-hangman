# constructor-hangman

I create a hangman command-line game using constructor functions. Why, you ask? Because who doesn't miss 80's style gaming.

About Hangman:

Hangman in case you didn't know is a quick and easy game that requires nothing more than (in this instance) a computer and the ability to spell. This app acts as "the host," meaning it will generate a secret word, while (you) the other player tries to guess the word by entering in letters.

For every letter you have guessed that appears in the word the dash will be replaced by that letter. However, every wrong guess brings you one step closer to losing.

GOOD L _ CK AND HAVE _ _ N !
